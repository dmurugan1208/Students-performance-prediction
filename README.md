# Predicting-Student-Performance-Using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to predict student performance based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and exam scores. The machine learning model trained on a dataset of student information can provide insights into predicting a student's performance in mathematics.

## Introduction

In today's educational landscape, understanding the factors that contribute to a student's academic performance is crucial for educators, parents, and policymakers. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict a student's performance in mathematics based on various factors. By providing accurate predictions, this tool can help identify students who may need additional support and tailor educational strategies accordingly.


## Features
- Predicts student performance in mathematics based on multiple factors.
- Provides insights into the influence of gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course on student performance.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using a supervised learning algorithm, such as a decision tree or random forest, to predict the math score based on the input features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting student performance in mathematics. The results demonstrate the significant impact of factors such as parental education, test preparation course, and lunch type on student scores.
